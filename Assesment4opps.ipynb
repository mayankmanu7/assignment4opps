        " Definition Recap:\n",
        " Encapsulation = wrapping up data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit (class).\n",
        " It also helps in restricting direct access to data by using access modifiers.\n",
        " Ways to Achieve Encapsulation in Python:\n",
        " 1. Using Classes\n",
        " Class binds data (attributes) and methods together.\n",
        " Example: A\n",
        "Car\n",
        " class containing both\n",
        "speed\n",
        " and\n",
        "drive()\n",
        " .\n",
        " 2. Access Modifiers in Python\n",
        " Python does not have strict private/protected keywords like Java or C++,\n",
        " but it achieves encapsulation through naming conventions:\n",
        " Public (default): Accessible everywhere.\n",

        " print(car.color)  # Accessible\n",
        " Protected (\n",
        " _var\n",
        " ): Should not be accessed directly outside class (convention)\n",
        " class Car:\n",
        "    def __init__(self):\n",
        "        self._speed = 120  # Protected\n",
        " car = Car()\n",
        " print(car._speed)  # Possible, but discouraged\n",
        " Private (\n",
        " __var\n",
        " ): Name mangling makes it harder to access from outside.\n",
        " class Car:\n",
        "    def __init__(self):\n",
        "        self.__engine_number = \"ENG123\"  # Private\n",

        " # print(car.__engine_number)   Error\n",
        " print(car._Car__engine_number)  #  Access through name mangling\n",

        " A constructor in Python is a special method that is automatically called when an object of a class is created.\n",
        " Its main job is to initialize the attributes (data members) of the object.\n",
        " In Python:\n",
        " The constructor method is always written as:\n",
        " def __init__(self, arguments):\n",
        "    # initialization code\n",
        " Note :- __init__ is a dunder method (double underscore)\n",
        "        self parameter refers to the current instance of the class\n",
        " ### Example 1: Simple Constructor\n",
        " ```python\n",
        " class Student:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name, age):  # constructor\n",

        " print(s2.name, s2.age)  # Output: Aditi 20\n",
        " Example 2: Default Constructor\n",
        " If no constructor is defined, Python provides a default constructor automatically.\n",
        " e.g:\n",
        " class Demo:\n",
        "    pass\n",
        " obj = Demo()  # Default constructor is called\n",

        " 1. Modularity (Code Reusability)\n",
        " Code is divided into classes and objects, making it modular and reusable.\n",
        " Once a class is created, it can be reused in different programs.\n",
        " 2. Encapsulation (Data Hiding)\n",

        " 4. Polymorphism\n",
        " The same function or method can work in different ways depending on the object.\n",
        " Makes the code more flexible and maintainable.\n",
        " 5. Abstraction\n",
        " Only essential details are shown, while complex implementation is hidden.\n",
        " Helps in reducing complexity.\n",
        " 6. Maintainability\n",
        " OOP code is easier to update, modify, and maintain because each class is independent.\n",
        " 7. Scalability\n",
